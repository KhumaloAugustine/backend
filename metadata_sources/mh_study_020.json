      "abstract": "The PSQI is a 19-item self-report instrument for assessing sleep quality. It measures seven domains of sleep: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. Global scores range from 0-21, with higher scores indicating worse sleep quality.",
